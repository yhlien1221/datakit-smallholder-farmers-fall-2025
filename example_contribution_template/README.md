# [Your Name] - [Challenge Name] Analysis

## Overview
Brief description of what you're analyzing and why it matters for Producers Direct and smallholder farmers.

## Research Questions
- Question 1: What specific question are you trying to answer?
- Question 2: What patterns are you looking for?
- Question 3: What insights do you hope to provide?

## Methodology

### Data Sources
- List the datasets you're using
- Note any external data sources (weather, agricultural calendars, etc.)
- Document any data preprocessing steps

### Approach
1. **Step 1**: Data loading and initial exploration
2. **Step 2**: Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. **Step 3**: Analysis techniques applied
4. **Step 4**: Visualization and interpretation
5. **Step 5**: Validation and testing

### Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x / R
- **Key Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, etc.
- **GenAI Tools Used**: ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc. (be specific about what and how)
- **Other Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Tableau, etc.

## Use of Generative AI

### Tools Used
- **ChatGPT**: Used for [specific purpose, e.g., "generating initial code structure for data loading"]
- **GitHub Copilot**: Used for [specific purpose, e.g., "autocompleting repetitive data cleaning code"]

### Human Review Process
- All AI-generated code was reviewed and tested for accuracy
- AI-generated insights were validated against the data
- Modified AI suggestions in the following ways: [list modifications]

### AI-Assisted vs. Human-Created
- **AI-Assisted**: [List which parts, e.g., "Initial data visualization code structure"]
- **Human-Created**: [List which parts, e.g., "All analysis logic, interpretation, and conclusions"]
