This directory should contain a file with name `pd_dataset.csv`, which is the Producers Direct dataset file originally provided in the [DataKit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jKTmb8R5GlM9uqQkB5fXd37o2bdX17JKB36mK-NqWFE/edit?usp=sharing). Said file is needed to run the code in `../../Data Cleaning.ipynb`, but I haven't pushed it to GitHub to avoid issues with this large file.
