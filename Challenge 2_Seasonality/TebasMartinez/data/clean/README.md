This directory should include the following clean datasets after running the code in `../../Data Cleaning.ipynb`:
- `EN_questions.csv` includes questions data in English from Kenya and Uganda.
- `ke_EN_questions.csv` includes questions data in English from Kenya.

All three datasets have the following columns:

- country
- topics
- text

These files haven't been pushed to GitHub since they are too large.
